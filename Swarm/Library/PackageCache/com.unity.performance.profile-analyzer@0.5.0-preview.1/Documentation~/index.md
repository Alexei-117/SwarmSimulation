# About Profile Analyzer
The Profile Analyzer aggregates and visualises frame and marker data from a set of [Unity Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Profiler.html) frames to help you reason about their behaviour over a number of frames, complementing the single frame analysis already available in the Unity Profiler.

# Technical details
## Requirements
This version of Profile Analyzer is compatible with the following versions of the Unity Editor:

* 5.6 and later

# Known-limitations
Profile Analyzer includes the following known limitations:

* The original profile data is not saved in the profile analyzer .pdata file. Therefore its recommended to store both the Unity Profiler .data file (or .raw file exported from a stand alone player) alongside the .pdata file.

* Clicking on a marker attempts to jump to the marker in the Unity Profiler if the same data is loaded. A selection must have previously been made in the Unity Profiler for this to work. The vertical height is not correct in the UI view in the Unity profiler.
